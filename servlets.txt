So in the following pull request: 
http://repo.lumesse.local/projects/TLK/repos/talentlink/pull-requests/4430/diff
we added new parameter to stored procedure. 
If the script is run and code line is not patched, than code can call procedure and the language parameter will not be passed.
In this case we receive error, as the procedure is overloaded (it works like overloading in Java) and it is not found any more.
