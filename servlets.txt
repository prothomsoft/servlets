tomcat 7

1. Use Tomcat installation (takes control of Tomcat installation)
2. mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=web.tomek -DartifactId=servlets -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false
3. set Targeted Runtimes
4. http://localhost:8080/servlets/
5. set servlet in src/main/java folder
6/ set tests in src/test/java folder

you cannot forward request which is commited (send to the client) -> IllegalStateException
HttpSession
ServletContext
HttpServletContext

So in the following pull request: 
http://repo.lumesse.local/projects/TLK/repos/talentlink/pull-requests/4430/diff
we added new parameter to stored procedure. 
If the script is run and code line is not patched, than code can call procedure and the language parameter will not be passed.
In this case we receive error, as the procedure is overloaded (it works like overloading in Java) and it is not found any more.

There is NO = in EL
EL is null friendly

. can be always converted to []

only officially-designated error pages get the exception object.

rtexprvalue is default false - so can take only String.
possible values for tag body are: empty, scriptless, tagdependent, JSP

target must evaluate to object
EL does not permit assignments

Tag file (.tag) uses JspContext instead of ServletContext.

JspFragment cannot contain scripting elements. SimpleTags cannot have a body that includes a JSP expression tag.
The on-arg getAttribute(String) is for page scope only. findAttribute looks all four scopes

JspContext can be cast to PageContext.

SkipPageException stops only the page that directly invoked the tag.

Page directive is not available in TAG file.

url-pattern has three types: EXACT MATCH, DIRECTORY MATCH, EXTENSION MATCH


It must go tomcat-users.xml realm

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
   <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
   <user username="tomcat" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, admin-gui"/>

   <role rolename="Admin" />
   <role rolename="Member" />
   <role rolename="Guest" />
   <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="Admin, Member, Guest" />
   <user username="member" password="member" roles="Member, Guest" />
   <user username="guest" password="guest" roles="Guest" />
